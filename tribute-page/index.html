                    Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah, his nam: Taqī ad-Dīn 'Aḥmad ibn Abd al-Ḥalīm ibn ʿAbd al-Salām al-Numayrī al-Ḥarrānī
                    (in Arabic "تقي الدين أحمد بن عبدالحليم بن عبدالسلام النميري الحراني")
                    Ibn Taymiyyah's own relationship,
                    as a religious scholar,
                    with the ruling apparatus was not always amicable.
                    It ranged from silence to open rebellion.
                    On occasions when he shared the same views and aims as the ruling authorities
                    his contributions were welcomed,
                     but when Ibn Taymiyyah went against the status quo,
                    he was seen as "uncooperative",
                    and on occasions spent much time in prison.
                    Ibn Taymiyyah's attitude towards his own rulers was based on the actions
                    of Muhammad's companions when they made an oath of allegiance to him as follows;
                    "to obey within obedience to God,
                    even if the one giving the order is unjust;
                    to abstain from disputing the authority of those who exert it;
                    and to speak out the truth,
                    or take up its cause without fear in respect of God,
                    of blame from anyone."
